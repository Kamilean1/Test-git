            <p id="First paragraph">My name is Kamile and I currently live in a small town 
            in Sweden called SÃ¤ffle. I am 22 years old and just 
            started taking a course in IT Tech. I am a beginner
            but I am excited to learn coding and much more! </p>

            <p class="Studies info">I previously studied Media and Photography in England at a 
            college by the name of Petroc. I have always wanted to have a 
            career in the media or marketing industry as I have always been
            so intrigued on how the whole process of creating a website or 
            advert works. I am a generally creative person and love to experiment
            with new things that involve design.</p>

            <p class="Hobbies">I love animals, especially cats! But sadly my family has a dog, I still love him of
            course. One of my hobbies is to actually go for walks in the evening with my dog 
            and my family. I don't actually have many hobbies right now but the ones that I 
            always tend to stick to are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Listening to music</li>
                <li>Playing video games</li>
                <li>Makeup</li>
                <li>Practicing the art of eyebrow tinting and tweezing on others</li>
            </ul>

        chose to continue my education in IT, add audio of favourite song, 
        add photo of Englad college I went to, maybe add 
        video of my Media coursework-->
