   <p>My name is Kamile and I currently live in a small town 
    in Sweden called SÃ¤ffle. I am 22 years old and just 
    started taking a course in IT Tech. I am a beginner
     but I am excited to learn coding and much more!

    <!--TODO: Don't forget to write about previous studies and why I 
        chose to continue my education in IT-->
